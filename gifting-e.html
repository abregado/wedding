    <blockquote>"Presence not Presents"</blockquote>
    <p class="text-start">
        Anyone who knows Ben, knows that he is not the biggest fan of gifting culture. Weddings and marriage celebrations are not excluded from this.
        There will be no "opening gifts" event on the day, and no public "put your gift on display" area.
        Please consider bringing no gift at all. We will be excited enough just to have you at the party.
    </p>

    <p class="text-start">
        If you really, really must give a gift, then please consider some of these ideas:
    </p>
    <ul class="giftlist w-75">
        <li>Suggest a tourist attraction from your area of Germany for the Australian guests.</li>
        <li>Offer to take one of the Australian guests for a day trip.</li>
        <li>Bring a camera and take some pictures of the day for us. </li>
    </ul>
