        To help with the organisation it would be great if you can fill out this simple Google Form
        to let us know if you are coming, and the size of your party. The form also includes questions about
        dietary requirements and if you are travelling from outside Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
        The results are not public. Only Carolin and I will have access. If you use a Google account or provide an email address, you will be able to change your entry at any time.

        Carolin has set up a Padlet for everyone to use. It requires a password, which you will need to ask us for. By default your posts will be Anonymous but if you make a Padlet account you can set your display name.
