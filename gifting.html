    <h2>Gifting</h2>
    <blockquote>"Presence not Presents"</blockquote>
    <p class="text-start">
        Anyone who knows me, knows that I don't like gifting culture. Weddings and marriage celebrations are often the worst examples of this.
        There will be no "opening gifts" event on the day, and no public "put your gift on display" area.
        Please consider bringing no gift at all. We will be excited enough just to have you at the party.
    </p>

    <p class="text-start">
        If you really, really must give a gift, then please consider some of these ideas:
    </p>
    <ul class="giftlist w-75">
        <li>An easily sharable food item for the party.</li>
        <li>An outdoor game (like Frisbee, Kubb, or Badminton) to play at the party.</li>
        <li>Suggest a tourist attraction from your area of Germany for the australian guests.</li>
        <li>Offer to take one of the australian guests for a day trip.</li>
        <li>Loan us a marquee or shelter tent for the day.</li>
        <li>Wedding photographer recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
