        Dear friends,<br><br>
        On Wednesday (Sept 7th), we discovered that we are Corona-infected. Obviously, this will change things for our wedding planning. Depending on how fast we recover, we might get married on Sept 14th or not. However, the picnic on Sept 17th will still go ahead, as it is already booked and paid. In the case of us still being positive, we will of course not attend the picnic. If we test negatively, we will attend. However, we want to give you the opportunity to withdraw your attendance if you feel uncomfortable with that.
        <br><br>We expect to recover and are still looking forward to seeing you soon!
