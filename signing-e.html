    <ul>
        <li>11:00am Meet at the Fountain of Justice</li>
        <li>11:30am Ceremony begins in the Town hall (Römer)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Town hall (Römer)</h3>
    <p>Before the ceremony we will meet in the Frankfurt old city at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Ks1WmwJhaRDaYbpaA">Fountain of Justice</a>.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>Town hall (Römer)</h3>
    <p>The "ceremony" is very minimalist and will take place in the <a href="https://www.frankfurt-tourismus.de/en/Media/Attractions/Buildings/Roemer-City-Hall#/article/d816044a-cd0e-4ad0-bff3-86874eefbc6f">Frankfurt Town hall (Römer)</a>. An official will say a few words in German, then we will sign some papers.</p>
    <p>The current regulations allow us to bring the full amount of 17 guests into the signing. This may change if the Corona restrictions come back into force. Regardless, everyone will need to bring and wear a FFP-2 mask.</p>
    <p>The whole ceremony will take about 20 minutes.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>Palmengarten</h3>
    <p>After the ceremony we will, as a group, take the tram to the <a href="https://www.palmengarten.de/de/150-jahre-palmengarten.html">Palmengarten</a>, which is a small botanical garden in Frankfurt. Here we can spend some time enjoying the park until lunch and thereafter.</p>


    <hr>
    <h3>Lunch</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.cafe-siesmayer.de/en/">Cafe Siesmayer</a> is found inside (and technically outside) the Palmengarten.</p>

    <h3>Dress code</h3>
    <p>
        You can dress up and pretend this is a standard wedding if you like. Caro will have a dress and Ben will have a shirt and tie. Let's go with Comfortable Formal.
